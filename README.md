## 1.1 Intro

A standard run-of-the-mill astrology website. Mainly making this to refresh my web skills, I do not endorse nor actively partake in astrology.

After watching [a great video by youtuber No Boilerplate](https://youtu.be/9K20e7jlQPA?si=p7w86InSUW4G6xuQ) and reading [a great article by software developer Gerald Benischke](https://beny23.github.io/posts/my_take_on_engineering_room_9/) I have decided to tear down what I have been taught about agile and try to adhere as closely as possible to [the original agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/). As No Boilerplate so aptly puts in his video "if the cost of failure is less than the cost of planning, YOU MUST NOT PLAN." I have nothing to lose, so I will be planning as little as possible and instead try to create. This project will have many versions and may become abandoned once I reach the desired criteria I have set forth for myself, but I *cannot* let myself become a victim of development purgatory (especially for a passion project like this).

## 1.2 Features (list will grow/change)
